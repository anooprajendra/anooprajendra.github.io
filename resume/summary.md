### Summary

Design, architect, and build large scale Linux clusters. Currently manage a
group that automates installation and deployment of Linux on clusters of
hundreds of compute and storage servers. Worked in every part of the Linux OS
dealing with network, storage, and compute stacks.

I'd like to work in a position where I can utilize my knowledge, expertise, and
experience in the field of HPC, Clusters, Cloud, and Storage systems, and apply
it, along with new and cutting edge technologies, to solve large scale
distributed computational and storage problems.
