### Summary

I design, architect, and build large scale Linux clusters. I currently manage a group
that automates installation and deployment of Linux on clusters of hundreds of
compute and storage servers. I've worked in every part of the Linux OS dealing
with network, storage, and compute stacks. I'd like to work in a position where
I can utilize my knowledge, expertise, and experience in the field of HPC,
Clusters, Cloud, and Storage systems, and apply it, along with new and cutting
edge technologies, to solve extremely large scale distributed computational and
storage problems.
